biggest_challenge: The biggest challenge in building this app was to position "problem of the day" in such a way that it didn't feel like a chore. All of the members of this group are either full-time designers, developers or master's students, so I knew the only way to get them to spend time on this was to make it fun and valuable.
best_thing_i_learned: This has been one of the most fulfilling projects of my career so far. What began as a group of 3 people including myself has turned into a group of 10 people with varying degrees of JavaScript experience, and the results have been better than any of us expected. I am a huge believer that starting a conversation about code (especially with people who are more experienced than you) is the best way to learn, and this project has helped us facilitate that conversation in a really awesome way.
up_next: Some of the next features to come on Codework are the ability to comment on submissions, searching and filtering by topic and tag, profile cards and more features that will continue to improve the learning experience for everyone.
challenge: What started as a Slack channel for a JavaScript problem of the day became an unwieldy list that was hard to refer back to and even harder to filter and search, so we needed a better way to deliver questions and answers.
process: Brainstorm most impactful pieces of learning programming and build that into an interactive app where contributors can answer daily questions and view and comment on other submissions.
solution: A React app connected to the CodeWars API allows us to expand our JavaScript group to facilitate a better conversation about code and best practices that can act as a living reference guide.
