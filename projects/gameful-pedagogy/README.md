biggest_challenge: One of the biggest challenges with the gameful pedagogy site was thinking about how to organize the information so that both people who were browsing and people who were looking for a specific answer could find what they needed. This presented an interesting information architecture problem to solve in addition to thinking through how to make text-heavy articles visually-appealing.
best_thing_i_learned: Creating this site was a good way to practice my skills using a static site generator like Jekyll and really served to build my skills in information architecture. I started with simply a list of frequently asked questions and ended up building a site that helped explain the pedagogy behind the GradeCraft application as well as provide resources for instructors that were building gameful courses.
up_next: In the next iteration of the gameful pedagogy site, we will need to update the content to cover features that have been added and improved upon since the site was launched as well as continue to think about what information should exist here and what should be more integrated into the GradeCraft tool itself.
challenge: Create a site that would function as a repository of resources and educational materials for instructors who were interested in incorporating gameful elements into their course design.
process: Gather and organize existing materials and brainstorm what else might be helpful for our instructors using or thinking about designing a gameful course.
solution: A Jekyll site that acts as a resource to anyone designing a gameful course with or without GradeCraft that is easily updated by the non-technical members of my team.
