    <p>I am a User Interface Designer and Developer at the <a href='http://ai.umich.edu/' target='_blank'>U-M Office of Academic Innovation</a> where I work on web applications that enhance the learning experience of students. I work all over the tech stack with frameworks like React, Django, and Rails. I also lead our student intern program and a JavaScript working group that meets weekly.</p>
    <p>When I am not glued to a MacBook screen, you can find me biking, hiking, playing rec sports, or watching college football. If you'd like to know more about my experiences or what I am currently working on, look for me on <a href='https://github.com/mariehooper' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> or check out my <a href='/docs/marie-hooper-resume.pdf' target='_blank'>resume</a>!</p>
